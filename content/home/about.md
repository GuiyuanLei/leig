# About me

I am a statistician, breast cancer survivor, and mother of two girls. I have been actively blogging in [wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com/) since 2009 (when I was diagnosed with breast cancer) talking about my daily life (cancer, children, education and travel etc). In this blog, I will focus on statistics/programming/oncology related topics.

I am a statistican working with Roche, a pharmaceutical/healthcare company. Because I am a cancer patient by myself, I am very passional about oncology drug development, not just apply my statistical and programming skills, but also to be knowledgeable in cancer area. My daily work is designing clinical trials, analyzing and intepreting data to evaluate efficacy and safety of cancer drugs. I have a wealth of exprience in exploratory biomarker works, to understand biology of disease and try to develop targeted therapy. 

Before I joined Roche, I have worked in academia as postdoc/research associate for five years in Sweden and UK. My research was mainly in Bayeisan Inference. My undergraduate degree was "Computational Mathematics and Applied software", I have been enthusiasm in programming and even got certificate in C programming. Now I use R most of time. So in addition to daily drug developement work, I provide statistics/programming training to my colleagues.
