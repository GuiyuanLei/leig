## Statistical Geneticist, Medical Research Council, Imperial College London (Aug. 2008 – Nov. 2008)

Linkage Analysis considering heterogeneity, inversion and conversion.

## Research Associate (Statistician), Newcastle University, UK (Nov. 2005 – Aug. 2008)

Provided statistical consultation to scientists. Developed algorithms and coded programs in Bayesian inference of genetic network using high through-put microarray expression data.

## Post-doc, Linkoping University, Sweden (Aug. 2003 – Aug. 2005)

Worked at the division of computational biology. Developed Monte Carlo optimization algorithms in searching Bayesian networks.
