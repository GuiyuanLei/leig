I have applied methods such as Propensity Scores, IPTW (inverse probability of treatment weighting), SSM (Sample Selection Models), IVA (Instrumental Variable Analysis) and CART (Classification and Regression Tree) to safety data analyses."

Worked closely with Biomarker Scientists, senior experimental statistician and member from Statistics Methods & Research Group. Examples of activities involving advanced expertise include:

* Genomic biomarker analysis.
* Multivariate and ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) analysis for biomarker. 
* Applied methods such as Propensity Scores, IPTW (inverse probability of treatment weighting), SSM (Sample Selection Models) and IVA (Instrumental Variable Analysis) to account for confounding in observational data
* CART (Classification and Regression Tree) for safety data.
