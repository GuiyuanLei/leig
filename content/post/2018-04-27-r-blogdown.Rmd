# Steps to create a website using blogdown

The quickest way is to let netlify to build an initial website for you once you have [Github account](https://github.com). 

1. For example, if you use "Academic" theme website, go to [Install Academic with Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-kickstart). Nelify will provide you with a customizable URL to access your new site. 

1. On GitHub, go to your newly created *academic-kickstart* (you can change the name) repository and edit config.toml to personalize your site. Shortly after saving the file, your site will automatically update

If you want to build website in your Rstudio by yourself, please read the post [Up and running with blogdown](https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/). I did not succeed at the step of "deploy" due to Hugo version.
