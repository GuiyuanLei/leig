abstract = "Using validated assays developed for FFPE tissue testing, we determined the prevalence and prognostic value of BCL2 in a frontline DLBCL population enrolled in a clinical trial. BCL2 expression appeared to be higher in the poor prognostic groups (high IPI and ABC), and appeared to be an independent prognostic factor in the GCB subtype. BCL2 expression, DP and COO may identify patients with DLBCL who could benefit from BCL2 inhibition; the assays employed here are currently in use to evaluate BCL2 as a predictive biomarker for the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax in lymphoma trials."
