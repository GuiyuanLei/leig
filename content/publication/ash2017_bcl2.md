abstract = "Using a newly developed BCL2 IHC scoring algorithm, we demonstrate that DLBCL patients positive for BCL2 have a consistently inferior prognosis compared with patients negative for BCL2. The prognostic value of BCL2 IHC is independent of IPI and COO in GOYA and BCCA. The Ventana assay is currently being used in a Phase 2 study of venetoclax in combination with R-CHOP to evaluate the correlation (if any) of BCL2 expression with venetoclax + R-CHOP treatment "
