abstract = "Large scale microarray experiments are becoming increasingly routine, particularly those which track a number of different cell lines through time. This time-course information provides valuable insight into the dynamic mechanisms underlying the biological processes being observed. However, proper statistical analysis of time-course data requires the use of more sophisticated tools and complex statistical models...CRAN and Bioconductor are stable repositories that provide a wide variety of appropriate statistical tools to analyse time course microarray data."
